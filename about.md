**Rodolfo Soto**
I am currently a graduate student from the University of Texas at Austin studying a Master of Science in Business Analytics. I am interested in solving business focused problems by utilizing Machine Learning and Analytics to maximize and optimize the use of data that normally remains untouched or forgotten by companies. My favorite tools for exploration and analysis are Python and R, where I use a variety of packages such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Caret, and many others.

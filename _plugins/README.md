Jekyll Plugins
==============

To install the plugins simply put them in a folder named `_plugins` in your
project directory.


Redcarpet 2
-----------

This plugin uses [Redcarpet 2](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) to render
Markdown, and [pygments](http://pygments.org/) for syntax hightlighting.

You should install the dependencies with bundler. You can add these lines to
your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'redcarpet', '~> 2.3'
gem 'albino', '~> 1.3'
```

And then run `bundle install`.

It's possible to choose the redcarpet that you want to use by adding theses
lines to the `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
markdown: redcarpet2
redcarpet:
  extensions: ["no_intra_emphasis", "fenced_code_blocks", "autolink", "strikethrough", "superscript", "with_toc_data"]
```

And the nice bonus is that you no longer need to `{% highlight %}` to
highlight code. You can simply use the fenced code blocks like on github:

    ```ruby
    puts "This code will be highlighted"
    ```
